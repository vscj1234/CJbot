It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum The man, who is in a stable condition in hospital, has “potentially life-changing injuries” after the overnight attack in Garvagh, County Lono donderry. He was shot in the arms and legs.”What sort of men would think it is accepttable to sub ject a young girl to this level of brutality and violence?
“Every child has the right to feel safe and protected in their own home – how is this poor child going to sleep tonight or in coming nights? What are the long term effects on her going to be?”
Content without backward-compatible data.
Their community. I wonder how they wou if their own child witnessed such a level of violence?
“There is absolutely no justification for an attack like this in our communities and we must all work together to bring those responsible to justice and to stop this from happening to another child.”
Earlier this month, the PSNI launched a hard-hitting advertisement campaign aimed at changing public attitudes to paramilitary attacks.
A Kentucky woman who was accused last year.
The intruders chased the girl in the house and threatened her when she hid from them, according to the PSNI Limavady Facebook page.
“She came out petrified with her Piggy Bank, HER PIGGY BANK! hoping that the men would take it and leave her dad alone,” one outraged officer wrote.
“What sort of men would think it is acceptable to subject a girl to this level of brutality and violence? an attack like thiop.”Neil Borton
